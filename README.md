# Sample for XMLRPC Call from JAVA
This sample contains how to send XMLRPC call from Java classes and it contains sample for data types.
Also sample request and sample response are included in packages and you can get how to convert java object to target XML.
Codes contains below data types:
* struct - java.util.Map
* array - java.util.List (Vector)
* int - Integer
* string - String
* dateTime.iso8601 - java.util.Date
* For data type details: https://ws.apache.org/xmlrpc/types.html

In addtion to above parts, I have added a class to get request and response as XML. And also there is a new function to print these XMLs pretty.
